1) f"{BASE_URL}/search/users?q=location:Singapore+followers:>100" . I used the following url to fetch the data of users belonging to Singapore with >100 followers. If you are facing rate limit errors , then please provide your access token along with a retry method when 403 error/rate limit error is found.And for internal data cleaning i used lstrip() , join() , upper() methods which are in-built functions in python.
2) One of the interesting i got to know after analyzing the data is that there are many inactive repositories with high star counts . poopular repos have also lacked in maintaining documentation in their projects . And many people have used several languages like Cobol,Lua,Raku,M4,StylusMakefile which are unheard yet used in high profile projects.
3) Actionable recommendation for the developers would be to maintain proper documentation for their repositories as they are very popular and high profile repos. License consistency should also be maintained.
